# Knowledge Owl (knowledge-owl)

The Knowledge Owl is a keeper of information. Whenever there is a topic - which falls within my field of interest - I try to hand it over to the Knowledge Owl as a nice article.

You will find articles about the following topics among others:
* Software Architecture
* Versioning
* Accessiblity
* Leadership
* Mentoring

Maybe, when I will find some spare time, I will turn this into a super fancy application. But for now it's just markdown...
